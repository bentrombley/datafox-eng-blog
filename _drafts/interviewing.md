# Interviewing is the Highest Leverage

Hacking is about doing the highest-leverage work.  In startups, we only build a feature if
we know customers need it, and then we only build the "minimum viable" amount.
We only optimize code when its performance is critical.  Great startup
employees thrive on making difficult choices and focusing on only the most critical tasks.

But when it comes to the single highest-leverage, most-critical job, most of us fall short: hiring.

Think about it: a good engineer can do iOS development, but a great iOS engineer understands how to
make an elegant app that your users will love.  If your business depends on mobile, which is increasingly
true for all businesses, this engineer's work will create an order of magnitude more impact than just a good engineer.
That's what companies mean when they look for a "10X" engineer: the difference in quality of work
translates into 10 times as much revenue (or usage) for the business.  In extreme cases like Instagram
or WhatsApp, the impact of having a great app is even higher.

But if a great iOS engineer is worth 10 times a good engineer, then if you can hire great iOS developers
you are worth an order magnitude more, even if you aren't an iOS developer.  Being a great interviewer can make
you a 100X engineer.

That's not just hyperbole: assembling a small team of outstanding engineers is probably the highest
leverage work any engineer can do, and it can prove the difference between being Instagram and all the
other also-rans.  (Of course, great engineers are necessary but not sufficient to success, just look at
Four Square).

Just as important, firing bad hires is an enormous drain in every sense.

# Why Interviewing Sucks

So if it's important, why is it not a priority?

0.  Interviewing is a chore

In my experience, interviewing is a chore for most engineers that ranks somewhere between filling out TPS reports and
debugging errors in IE6.  You check your calendar and audibly sigh as you see your pristine afternoon
interrupted by an interview.  When the time arrives, you're in the middle of doing something important, and
this is the last thing you want to do.  You go to the room

1. Interviewing is not rewarded

I've never worked in a place that rewarded engineers for being great interviewers and devoting time.  Sure,
there are sizable bonuses for recruiting your friends, but there is no reward for devoting substantial
time each week to interviewing.

2.  Interviewing is not regarded as a skill

Engineers thrive on respect for their skills.  You get respect for solving a complex backend issue,
or for designing an elegant UI, or simply for automating an obnoxious manual process.  That respect is
valuable because it took effort to master those skills, and creates an incentive for others to learn it.
Being a great interiewer rarely comes up in this context -- at best the hiring managers appreciates
it.

3.  Engineers aren't salesmen

Honestly, many people are drawn to engineering because they are introverted, and that's fine.  But you
expect great engineers to do things outside their comfort zone whether it's configuring nginx or adopting
pair programmming.  Which bring us back to the importance of interviewing: why would you hire someone
who can't adapt?

An extremely important part of interviewing is selling yourself to the candidate.  But this is not the same
as sales.  You're pitching your team to an engineer: explain why you are excited.  People recognize genuine
enthusiasm and passion, and they're rare.



# How to Make Interviewing Your Companies Competitive Advantage

Let's start with a simple fact: interviewing is hard.  Really, really hard.  And no one is very good at it [citation needed].
In a traditional view it's depressing how daunting it is.

However, viewed as a startup, the fact that no one is good at interviewing is exciting.  If you nail interviewing,
you have an enormous advantage over your competitors, and one they're unlikely to imitate.

So how do you do it?

1. Be on time

It's amazing to me that companies are willing to pay a recruiter $25k or more for a hire, but when someone comes to interview
they can be left for minutes on end while interviewers run late.

The message is clear: interviewing is not a priority here, and we don't have our act together.


2. Know why you are asking a question

There is ample evidence that brain teasers are useless in predicting job performance [citation needed].  So why are people
still asking them?

3.  You don't need to be anxious

It's nerve-wracking the first time you're on the other side of the table asking the questions.  I felt like an
imposter, and worried that the candidate would call me out for not knowing what I was talking about.

Let's just be clear: this never happens.  The person being interviewed is far more nervous than you are as the
interviewer, and they want to make a good impression.  I have had candidates badger me about a question or about
how

3.5 You can interview people who are smarter or more expert than you

The whole goal is to hire people better than you.  You can always ask questions like:

* Why did you pick that solution?  What are the trade-offs?
* How would you scale this?
* Great, now if I change this requirement, what has to change?

4. Let them do the talking

"When you're speaking you're not learning," as the saying goes.

Just as importantly, people like talking about themselves and will like you more for it [citation].  Effective sales people spend most of their time
asking questions, not pitching the product.  Great teachers lead you to the answer, they don't just state it.
Note that this works just as well in reverse: if your interviewer spends most of the time talking about themself,
you will likely get a glowing review.




## Be Metrics-Driven

It's shocking how companies that pride themselves on their analysis and metrics fall flat when it comes to interviewing. Even those that do collect metrics, often prove only that their (system does not work)[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html].

All of the evidence I have seen shows that

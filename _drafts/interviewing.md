# Interviewing is the Highest Leverage Use of Your Time

Hacking is all about leverage.  In startups, we only build a feature if
we know customers need it, and then we only build the "minimum viable" amount.
In growth hacking you focus on the quickest, cheapest ways to get viral adoption.  Great startup
employees thrive on making difficult choices and focusing on only the most critical tasks.

But when it comes to the single highest-leverage, most-critical job, most of us fall short: interviewing.

Think about it: a good engineer can do iOS development, but a great iOS engineer builds an elegant
app users love. That's what companies mean when they look for a "10X" engineer: their skill
translates into 10 times the user adoption and revenue -- that's the difference between being WhatsApp
and whatever else.

But if a great iOS engineer is worth 10 times a good engineer, then if you can hire great iOS developers
you are worth an order magnitude more, even if you aren't an iOS developer.  Being a great interviewer can make
you a 100X engineer.

That's not just hyperbole: assembling a small team of outstanding engineers is probably the highest
leverage work any engineer can do, and it can prove the difference between being Instagram and all the
other also-rans.  (Of course, great engineers are necessary but not sufficient to success, just look at
Four Square).

Just as important, firing bad hires is an enormous drain in every sense.

# Why Interviewing Sucks

So if interviewing is important, why is it not a priority?

0.  Interviewing is a chore

In my experience, interviewing is a chore for most engineers that ranks somewhere between filling out TPS reports and
debugging errors in IE6.  You check your calendar and audibly sigh as you see your pristine afternoon
interrupted by an interview.  When the time arrives, you're in the middle of doing something important, and
this is the last thing you want to do.  You suffer through it, fill out whatever paperwork is required, and get back
to your real work.

1. Interviewing is not rewarded

I've never worked in a place that rewarded engineers for being great interviewers and devoting time.  Sure,
there are sizable bonuses for recruiting your friends, but there is no reward for devoting substantial
time each week to interviewing or to being a reliable judge of candidate quality.  Good managers certainly
appreciae these skills and might go so far as to commend someone privately, but I've never seen interviewing
on the list of skills an engineer is evaluated on.

2.  Interviewing is not regarded as a skill

Engineers thrive on respect for their skills.  You get respect for solving a complex backend issue,
or for designing an elegant UI, or simply for automating an obnoxious manual process.  That respect is
valuable because it took effort to master those skills, and creates an incentive for others to learn it.
Being a great interiewer rarely comes up in this context -- at best the hiring managers appreciates
it.

3.  Engineers don't do sales

Honestly, many engineers are introverts, and that's fine.  But you
expect great engineers to do things outside their comfort zone whether it's configuring nginx or adopting
pair programmming.  (Which bring us back to the importance of interviewing: why would you hire someone
who can't adapt?)

An extremely important part of interviewing is selling yourself to the candidate.  But this is not the same
as sales.  You're pitching your team to an engineer: explain why you are excited.  People recognize genuine
enthusiasm and passion, and they're rare.  If you're not genuinely excited, then maybe it's time to move.



# How to Make Interviewing Your Company's Competitive Advantage

Let's start with a simple fact: interviewing is hard.  Really, really hard.  And no one is very good at it [citation needed].
Most people might call that fact depressing, but as a startup it means opportunity.  If you nail interviewing,
you have an enormous advantage over your competitors, and one they're unlikely to imitate.

So how do you do it?

1. Be on time

It's amazing to me that companies are willing to pay a recruiter $25k or more for a hire, but when someone comes in to interview
they're left sitting alone in a room while the interviewers run late.

The message is clear: interviewing is not a priority here, and we don't have our act together.

The solution is simple: there's no excuse for being late.


2.  You don't need to be anxious

It's nerve-wracking the first time you're on the other side of the table asking the questions.  I felt like an
imposter, and worried that the candidate would call me out for not knowing what I was talking about.

Let's just be clear: this never happens.  The person being interviewed is far more nervous than you are as the
interviewer, and they want to make a good impression.  Yes, I have had candidates badger me about why our company
does this or chose that, but really it only proved that they would not be terrible to work with.


3. You can interview people who are smarter and more experienced than you

The whole goal is to hire people better than you.  This is intimidating, but that doesn't matter (see previous point).

If you can pick a dentist or an auto-mechanic, you can tell who is a machine learning expert or great iOS engineer.  When
someone starts going over your head on a topic, just probe with questions like:

* Why did you pick that solution?  What are the trade-offs?
* How would (did) you scale this?
* How would (did) you test this?
* Great, now if I change this requirement, what has to change?

You can tell when someone knows what they're talking about, and when they're just bluffing based on something they read.

4. Let them do the talking

"When you're speaking you're not learning," as the saying goes.

You can learn a lot when the candidate gets stuck.  Can they step back and reassess the problem?  Do they ask good questions?  Or
do they get frustrated and quit?  You know which type of person you'd like to work with.

Just as importantly, people like talking about themselves and will like you more for it [citation].  Effective sales people spend most of their time
asking questions, not pitching the product.  Great teachers lead you to the answer, they don't just state it.

Note that this works just as well in reverse: if your interviewer spends most of the time talking about themself,
you will likely get a glowing review.

5.  You have to make a decision

We use a dead-simple system: rate the candidate 1-4 where 1 is "I will argue against the hire" and 4 is "I will argue for the hire."
The key is that *you cannot be 2.5 in the middle*.  You have to leave the interview with a decision of whether or not you want to
work with this person.  It will always be tempting to not decide, but it's not an option.

## So What Do You Ask?

Good questions take a long time to develop and are constantly being approved.

4. Know why you are asking a question

This sounds obvious, but few interviewers seem to be asking a question because they have to ask something.  That's why so many
people still ask brain teasers, despite the ample evidence that these questions do not predict job performance [citation needed].

The appeal of asking a riddle is that it has a nice clear answer you can evaluate.  The problem is that getting the answer right doesn't mean much.

Let's be clear: _your mission is to walk out of the interview knowing if you should hire this person or not_.  If you just know
that they can solve your question, you've wasted everyone's time.

5. Don't ask algorithms questions

This is controversial because so many engineers love algorithm-based questions, but here's why I think they're damaging:

* They reward recent college graduates who just took an algorithms class over experienced engineers who have solved real
problems.
* These questions often focus on obscure data structures or intricate big-O notation, when in practice you'd really want them
to just use a simple hash table or sorting library.
* Yes, algorithms are part of coding, but so is security, networking, user interaction, debugging, localization, etc. Why
prioritize algorithms?
* Algorithm questions are too often all-or-nothing puzzles that punish good candidates that don't happen to get the solution.

In my experience, interviewers ask about algorithms because they personally enjoy them, not because they are a
sign of doing well on the job.  And that's not fair.


3.  Make your questions fair

Let's start with the worst interview question you can think of.  Mine is: "I'm thinking of a number
in my head, what is it?"

Obviously, it's ridiculous, but why is it so bad?  It's
arbitrary and unfairly punishes someone for guessing wrong.  It leaves the candidate feeling foolish and you've learned
nothing about them except.

The problem with many questions, and particularly puzzle or algorithm questions, is that they have
all of these qualities.

First, be really clear what you care about in an answer.  If this is a question about concurrency then say so.
If what you actually care about is clean code, then say so.  If you're testing for knowledge of iOS libraries
and best practices then say so.  It's obvious to you when you say "sort a linked list" that you mean "implement
a highly performant implementation from scratch," but another interviewer means "use the LinkedList sort method, like in
real life."  Don't punish someone for guessing wrong.

Second, make sure your question is nuanced enough to test the full range of candidates.  "Guess a number" questions have
black-or-white answers, so you can't tell if someone is okay or great or in between.  A great question starts simply
and increases in complexity as the candidate works through it.  For example, ask them to design a scheduler
starting with something simple like a queue, then introducing concurrency or memory constraints.  Exceptional candidates
not only answer the question, but discuss trade-offs between different solutions and dive into advanced topics
like scaling and testing.

4. Interview for testing

Which brings us to a great question virtually no one asks in interviews: how would you test this?  Testing is poorly
taught in school yet is one of the most important skills that distinguish great engineers from mediocre ones.  You spend
far more time reading and testing code then you spend writing it, no matter whether you're doing frontend design or
low-level assembly.

Hiring someone without a question on testing is like hiring a chauffeur without asking if they can drive.

5. Make your question interesting by making it real

Again, half the point of the interview is to sell the candidate on the position.  Asking generic questions about data modeling
misses the chance to explain why the problems you are solving are hard and interesting.   You can get the same data
from discussing a real problem you've solved.  Or it can even be a problem you haven't solved yet -- maybe they'll give you
some new ideas.  A great candidate should engage with the problem and get excited about what you're working on, and you'll get
a more realistic idea what they would be like to work with.


# Or Don't Ask Anything

It's a mistake to view the hiring process as just a series of questions.  One radical option is to eschew all questions and simply
ask the engineer to work on a job as a contractor.  Or a scaled-back version is to ask them to come in for a day and pair-program
with you.  This benefit of this approach is that you get to see how someone performs in the actual job they will have.  However, you
should expect this approach will take a serious investment in time before you have a standardized way to compare candidates.  This
also works best if you can expect the candidate to know the language and tools.

So far, we've had luck working with engineers on a project-basis to see how they perform on real tasks, but haven't figured out the
best way to do peer-programming with our particular environment.


# Get Constantly Better

Apply some lean methodology to your interviewing by building in feedback.

First, you should leave every interview asking yourself, "What could I have asked to be more sure about my decision?"  This is
especially apt when you really aren't sure if this person is a good fit.  For example, you think someone is smart but might
not be resourceful and self-sufficient enough for a startup environment -- could you have asked about a time they had to be resourceful
at their last job?  Or can they talk about an experience where they went outside their comfort zone?  Make this question part
of your team's interview.

Second, have other engineers shadow you and do likewise for them.  It feels awkward, but do it anyway.  You'll never know how
you are coming across if you don't get feedback.  Your peers can also share what works and what doesn't when evaluating candidates.

## Don't Let Results Be Skewed by Bias

Be aware that there is a strong bias in interviewing to be negative about a candidate.  When you are a positive about someone and hire them,
you might learn that they were a bad fit.  But if you were negative and don't hire the candidate, no one will know if they would have
been a great fit.  Moreover, it's always safer to be critical than to put yourself out there in a group discussion.

You can't avoid this bias, but you can prevent it from paralyzing your interview process being aware of it.  Don't interviewers to be
negative of all candidates, and don't reward post-hoc analysis that punishes someone for being decisive.  If anything, you should reward
people who recognize great hires even when they others were skeptical.


## Be Metrics-Driven

It's shocking how companies that pride themselves on their analysis and metrics fall flat when it comes to interviewing. Even those that do collect metrics, often prove only that their (system does not work)[http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/business/in-head-hunting-big-data-may-not-be-such-a-big-deal.html].

Collecting metrics on interviewing is hard, but that's not an excuse to not do so.  You should understand your interview pipeline just as well as your sales pipeline,
and be constantly improving its weak points.

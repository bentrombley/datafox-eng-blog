Make sure to generate a new UUID for each new page (use v4 if you're wondering). The `uuid` field is necessary to provide a unique ID to each post for our Disqus threads.

Add any images to the `/assets/posts/img` directory and reference like this in your post:

    <img src="/assets/posts/img/path/to/my/file.jpg" width="100%" />

You can preview your post by visiting [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser.


## Submitting for Review

Commit your new file in the `_drafts` folder and push to the repo or Phabricator (`arc diff`) for others to see.


## Publishing

Use `git mv` to move your draft file to the `_posts` folder and put the publish date at the beginning like `2017-01-01-my-post.md`.

Commit your change and push to the repo, and it will be automatically built and live within 5 minutes (usually faster).



## Docker Setup

First, get docker, and install:
* [Mac instructions](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/), [Package](https://download.docker.com/mac/stable/Docker.dmg)
* Linux: [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/ubuntu/)

Once installed, you can check everything is up and running:
```
docker --version
docker-compose --version
docker-machine --version (Mac-only)
```
#### Linux only
On Linux, to manage docker as non-root user, add your user to ```docker``` group:
```
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
and load on startup:
```
sudo systemctl enable docker
```
And if you are using NetworkManager, add a DNS for Docker and restart:
```
echo 'json { "dns": ["8.8.8.8", "8.8.4.4"] }' | sudo tee /etc/docker/daemon.json
sudo service docker restart
```
